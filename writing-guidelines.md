## Core Principles

### 1. Results First
Lead with outcomes, not responsibilities. Hiring managers want to know what you've accomplished.

**Bad:** "Managed SEO for an e-commerce website"
**Good:** "Grew organic traffic 340% in 6 months for a Shopify art store"

### 2. Specific Beats Vague
Numbers, percentages, and concrete examples are more convincing than adjectives.

**Bad:** "Significant revenue growth"
**Good:** "$2M+ in online sales across multiple brands"

### 3. Human Over Corporate
Write like you talk. Contractions are fine. Personality is good. Stiff corporate speak is not.

**Bad:** "I leverage data-driven strategies to optimize digital presence"
**Good:** "I dig into analytics to figure out what's actually working"

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### Homepage

**Goal:** Hook visitors in 5 seconds. Answer "Who is this and why should I care?"

**Structure:**
1. Clear headline (who you are + what you do)
2. One-sentence value prop
3. Key achievement or proof point
4. Clear CTA

**Example:**
> **Jesse Johnson**
> Digital marketer and e-commerce specialist with $2M+ in online sales.
> I build brands that grow. Check out my work.

**Don't:**
- Start with "Welcome to my portfolio"
- Use vague descriptions ("digital enthusiast")
- Bury the good stuff below the fold

### About Page

**Goal:** Build credibility and connection. Let them know the person behind the work.

**Include:**
- Your story (brief, relevant)
- Key achievements with numbers
- Skills tied to results
- What you're looking for now

**Tone:** Professional but personable. You're a real person, not a LinkedIn bot.

**Don't:**
- Write a novel
- List every job you've ever had
- Use third person
- Sound desperate

---

### Portfolio/Case Studies

**Goal:** Prove you can do the work. Show process and results.

**Structure for each project:**
1. Project name and one-line description
2. The challenge/goal
3. What you did (brief)
4. Results (numbers preferred)
5. Visuals (screenshots, metrics)

**Example:**
> **Luxury Wall Art**
> Built and scaled a Shopify + Etsy art store from zero to $120K in revenue.
>
> **Challenge:** Create a profitable e-commerce business in a crowded market.
>
> **What I did:** Product sourcing via AI tools, SEO strategy (340% organic growth), paid ads management, content creation.
>
> **Results:** 3,000+ products, 4,900+ ranking keywords, profitable within 12 months.

**Goal:** Make it easy to reach you. Remove friction.

**Include:**
- Simple form (name, email, message)
- Direct email address
- LinkedIn link
- What you're looking for ("open to full-time roles in digital marketing")

**Don't:**
- Ask for too much info
- Hide your email
- Use vague CTAs ("reach out")

---
