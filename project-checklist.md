## Notes

- Primary focus: landing a job, not freelance clients
- Every piece of copy should answer: "What can Jesse do for this company?"
- Proof beats claims. Show results, not just skills.
- Keep it simple. Don't over-design.
- Lead with current employment (Quality Sewing) to show you're actively working
- Calculator tools are a differentiator: show you can build, not just use
