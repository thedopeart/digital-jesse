## Global Style & Tone

All content for this project must follow these rules:

### Voice
- Confident but not arrogant. Let results speak for themselves.
- Professional yet personable. You're talking to potential employers, clients, and fellow creators.
- Clear, direct, and grounded. Jesse is a builder who ships real things, not someone who talks in abstractions.
- Write naturally. Output should sound human and pass AI detection.
- Stay grammatically correct without being stiff or robotic.
- Match the context: portfolio copy is polished but not corporate. Tool descriptions are practical. Blog content is conversational.

### Brevity
- Be concise. Every sentence should earn its place.
- Lead with value. What can Jesse do for them?
- Avoid padding and filler words.
- Match detail level to information provided. Minimal info = minimal copy. Don't invent details.

### Formatting
- Never use em dashes. Use periods, commas, or colons instead.
- No emojis unless explicitly requested.
- No external links unless explicitly provided.

## AI Detection Avoidance

All content must sound natural and human. AI-generated content hurts credibility, triggers reader skepticism, and may be penalized by search engines.

**Why This Matters:** AI detectors analyze patterns, probabilities, and sentence structure. They look for predictable rhythm (AI text lacks "burstiness"), overused vocabulary, and formulaic structures.

### Banned Words (never use)

| Category | Words to Ban |
|----------|--------------|
| Superlatives | exceptional, unparalleled, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, revolutionary, transformative, remarkable, game-changing |
| Corporate buzzwords | leverage, synergy, robust, seamless, holistic, paradigm, streamline, optimize, utilize |
| Overused adjectives | comprehensive, vital, pivotal, compelling, intriguing, thought-provoking, incredible, amazing, captivating, exquisite, stunning, majesty |
| Action verbs | unleash, unlock, empower, embark, delve, foster, navigate, harness, elevate |
| Transitions | furthermore, moreover, additionally, consequently, thus, hence |
| AI favorites | tapestry, multifaceted, meticulous, testament, endeavors, realm, myriad, plethora, paramount, intricate, bespoke, curated, a touch of |

### Use Instead

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| exceptional | really good, worth it |
| comprehensive | complete, full, everything you need |
| seamlessly integrated | works well together, fits right in |
| navigate the landscape | figure out, find your way through |
| foster meaningful connections | actually connect, get closer |
| embark on a journey | try, start with |
| leverage this opportunity | use this, take advantage of |
| it's important to note | (just state it directly) |
| captivating | striking, eye-catching |
| stunning | bold, striking |

### Banned Phrases (never use)

| Category | Phrases to Ban |
|----------|----------------|
| Generic openers | "Whether you're...", "In today's world...", "In the ever-evolving landscape...", "In an age where...", "In the world of...", "Passionate about..." |
| Filler phrases | "It's important to note that", "This means that", "When it comes to", "At its core", "It's worth noting" |
| AI conclusions | "In conclusion", "In summary", "In essence", "Only time will tell", "It remains to be seen", "Paving the way" |
| Empowerment clichés | "Take X to the next level", "Unlock your potential", "Transform your approach", "Transform your space", "Make a statement" |
| Creative clichés | "Embark on a journey", "A tapestry of...", "Woven into the fabric of...", "Paint a picture with words" |
| Vague benefits | "Designed to help", "Can be used to", "May help you", "Aims to provide" |
| Sales phrases | "Look no further", "Not only... but also", "Rest assured", "Dive into", "A wide array of", "Game-changing" |
| Portfolio clichés | "I bring ideas to life", "I craft experiences", "I tell stories through design", "Detail-oriented professional", "Digital Dreamweaver" |
| Vague claims | "Results-driven", "Self-starter", "Team player", "Think outside the box", "Wear many hats" |
| Current site problems | "tapestry", "transformative growth", "digital dreams", "birthing a digital experience" |

### Sentence Structure Red Flags

Avoid these AI writing patterns:
- Formulaic introductions starting with broad hook statements
- Symmetrical lists with perfectly balanced pros/cons
- Repetitive connectors ("however," "therefore," "in addition")
- Uniform sentence length (AI struggles to mix short and long naturally)
- Three adjectives in a row ("innovative, comprehensive, transformative")
- Starting paragraphs with "Additionally," "Furthermore," or "Moreover"

### How to Sound Human

Do these:
- Use contractions: "don't" not "do not", "I've" not "I have", "you'll" not "you will"
- Add casual transitions: "honestly," "to be fair," "the thing is," "here's the deal"
- Vary sentence length dramatically (3 words. Then maybe twenty-five words with commas and parentheses.)
- Use first person naturally: I, we, you, my, your
- Include specific numbers and results
- Use idioms and colloquialisms: "a no-brainer," "worth checking out," "solid choice"
- Read it aloud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn bio generator, rewrite it.

Don't do these:
- Start paragraphs with transitional adverbs
- Use three adjectives in a row
- Write vague claims without proof
- End with generic calls-to-action
- Write perfectly balanced bullet points
- Use em dashes (use commas, periods, or parentheses instead)

### Opening Sentence Rules
- Never start with "Welcome to" or "Introducing"
- Never start with a question
- Never start with "Looking for...?"
- Get to the point immediately

## Content Priorities

When writing for this site, prioritize:

1. **Specific results over vague claims** - "$2M in sales" beats "successful entrepreneur"
2. **Show don't tell** - Portfolio examples over skill lists
3. **What you can do for them** - Frame experience as value for employers/clients
4. **Proof points** - Brands built, traffic grown, revenue generated

---

## Project Structure

```
/CLAUDE.md                    # This file (project instructions)
/writing-guidelines.md        # Detailed writing standards
/project-checklist.md         # Website rebuild task tracker
/content-structure.md         # Site architecture and page outlines

/assets/                      # Images, logos, portfolio screenshots
/content/                     # Page copy drafts
```

## Current Site Issues to Fix

Based on review of digitaljesse.com:

1. **Copy is too generic** - "Digital Dreamweaver", "tapestry", "transformative growth" are AI red flags
2. **Missing specific results** - Need concrete numbers and outcomes
3. **Broken pages** - /services returns 404
4. **Structure unclear** - Services vs Portfolio overlap
5. **No clear CTA** - What action should visitors take?
6. **Weak positioning** - Site reads as freelancer, not job candidate

---

## Target Audience

1. **Hiring managers** - Looking for digital marketing, e-commerce, or creative roles
2. **Potential clients** - Small businesses needing digital services
3. **Collaborators** - Other creatives or entrepreneurs for projects

Write for audience #1 primarily. The site should function as a living resume that proves capabilities through work examples.
