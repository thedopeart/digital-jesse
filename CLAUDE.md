---

## AI Detection Avoidance

All content must sound natural and human. AI-generated content hurts credibility with recruiters and clients.

### Banned Words (never use)

| Category | Words to Ban |
|----------|--------------|
| Superlatives | exceptional, unparalleled, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, revolutionary, transformative, remarkable, game-changing |
| Corporate buzzwords | leverage, synergy, robust, seamless, holistic, paradigm, streamline, optimize, utilize |
| Overused adjectives | comprehensive, vital, pivotal, compelling, intriguing, thought-provoking, incredible, amazing, captivating, exquisite, stunning |
| Action verbs | unleash, unlock, empower, embark, delve, foster, navigate, harness, elevate |
| Transitions | furthermore, moreover, additionally, consequently, thus, hence |
| AI favorites | tapestry, multifaceted, meticulous, testament, endeavors, realm, myriad, plethora, paramount, intricate, bespoke, curated |

### Banned Phrases (never use)

| Category | Phrases to Ban |
|----------|----------------|
| Generic openers | "Whether you're...", "In today's world...", "In the ever-evolving landscape...", "In an age where...", "Passionate about..." |
| Filler phrases | "It's important to note that", "This means that", "When it comes to", "At its core", "It's worth noting" |
| Portfolio clichés | "I bring ideas to life", "I craft experiences", "I tell stories through design", "Detail-oriented professional", "Digital Dreamweaver" |
| Vague claims | "Results-driven", "Self-starter", "Team player", "Think outside the box", "Wear many hats" |
| Current site problems | "tapestry", "transformative growth", "digital dreams", "birthing a digital experience" |

### How to Sound Human

Do these:
- Use contractions: "don't" not "do not", "I've" not "I have"
- Add casual transitions: "honestly," "to be fair," "the thing is," "here's the deal"
- Vary sentence length dramatically
- Use first person naturally
- Include specific numbers and results
- Read it aloud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn bio generator, rewrite it.

Don't do these:
- Start paragraphs with transitional adverbs
- Use three adjectives in a row
- Write vague claims without proof
- Use em dashes (use commas, periods, or parentheses instead)

## Content Priorities

When writing for this site, prioritize:

1. **Specific results over vague claims** - "$2M in sales" beats "successful entrepreneur"
2. **Show don't tell** - Portfolio examples over skill lists
3. **What you can do for them** - Frame experience as value for employers/clients
4. **Proof points** - Brands built, traffic grown, revenue generated

## Project Structure

```
/CLAUDE.md                    # This file (project instructions)
/writing-guidelines.md        # Detailed writing standards
/project-checklist.md         # Website rebuild task tracker
/content-structure.md         # Site architecture and page outlines

/assets/                      # Images, logos, portfolio screenshots

```

## Current Site Issues to Fix

Based on review of digitaljesse.com:

1. **Copy is too generic** - "Digital Dreamweaver", "tapestry", "transformative growth" are AI red flags
2. **Missing specific results** - Need concrete numbers and outcomes
3. **Broken pages** - /services returns 404
4. **Structure unclear** - Services vs Portfolio overlap
5. **No clear CTA** - What action should visitors take?
6. **Weak positioning** - Site reads as freelancer, not job candidate

---

## Target Audience

1. **Hiring managers** - Looking for digital marketing, e-commerce, or creative roles
2. **Potential clients** - Small businesses needing digital services
3. **Collaborators** - Other creatives or entrepreneurs for projects

Write for audience #1 primarily. The site should function as a living resume that proves capabilities through work examples.
