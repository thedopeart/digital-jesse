# Content Brief Generator — Build Plan

## Quick Summary

**What:** A free tool that analyzes top-ranking pages for any keyword and generates a content brief — word count, headers to include, questions to answer, related topics.

**Cost to build & run:** $0 — uses only free tools and no paid APIs.

**Tech:** Next.js + Cheerio + web scraping of Google results. No AI APIs required.

**Differentiator:** Agencies charge $200+ per content brief. Yours is free and transparent about methodology.

---

## The Core Problem

When writing content to rank, most people either:
- Guess what to include and hope for the best
- Manually analyze top results (tedious, time-consuming)
- Pay $99+/month for tools like Clearscope, Surfer, or Frase
- Hire agencies that charge $150-300 per brief

**Your tool automates the manual research process for free.**

The insight is simple: Google has already told you what it wants to rank — look at what's already ranking and reverse-engineer the formula.

---

## What Makes This Tool Different

**Existing tools:** Expensive, complex dashboards with overwhelming data.

**Your tool:** One keyword in → one actionable brief out. No subscription, no learning curve.

**Positioning:** "Get a $200 content brief in 30 seconds. Free."

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack (100% Free)

| Component | Tool | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Framework | Next.js | Free |
| Hosting | Vercel | Free tier |
| HTML Parsing | Cheerio (npm) | Free |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Free |
| Text Analysis | Custom JS | Free |
| SERP Data | See options below | Free |
| AI/APIs | None required | Free |

### The Google Problem

**Challenge:** Getting SERP results without paying for an API.

**Options:**

1. **User provides URLs manually (MVP safest)**
   - "Paste the top 5 URLs ranking for your keyword"
   - Avoids scraping issues entirely
   - More friction but 100% reliable

2. **Free SERP API tiers**
   - SerpApi: 100 free searches/month
   - ValueSERP: 25 free searches/month
   - Use for demo, require user's own key for heavy use

3. **Scrape Google directly (risky)**
   - Works but Google blocks aggressively
   - Would need proxy rotation
   - Not recommended for MVP

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (user pastes URLs). Add free API tier as enhancement. Frame it as "we don't limit your searches — you're in control."

### Key NPM Packages (All Free)

```bash
npm install cheerio        # HTML parsing
npm install stopword       # Remove common words
npm install pdf-lib        # PDF generation (optional)
```

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind
- **Key UI Components:**
  - Keyword input with optional settings
  - URL paste area (for MVP approach)
  - Progress indicator
  - Formatted brief output with sections
  - Copy buttons per section + full brief
  - Export options

### Backend / Processing

**API Route Flow (MVP with manual URLs):**
```
1. Receive keyword + array of competitor URLs (5-10)
2. For each URL:
   - Fetch HTML content
   - Parse with Cheerio
   - Extract: title, headings, body text, FAQ sections
   - Calculate word count
   - Extract key phrases using TF-IDF
3. Aggregate across all pages:
   - Average word count
   - Common headings (appear 3+ times)
   - Question patterns
   - Frequent terms
4. Generate structured brief
5. Return JSON for frontend rendering
```

### Content Analysis Approach

**100% free, no-API approach:**

```javascript
// Extract page data
function analyzePage(html, url) {
  const $ = cheerio.load(html);
  
  return {
    url,
    title: $('title').text(),
    wordCount: $('body').text().split(/\s+/).length,
    h2s: $('h2').map((i, el) => $(el).text()).get(),
    h3s: $('h3').map((i, el) => $(el).text()).get(),
    faqs: extractFAQs($), // Look for FAQ schema or Q&A patterns
    keyTerms: extractKeyTerms($('body').text()),
  };
}

// Find common headers across pages
function findCommonHeaders(pages) {
  const headerCounts = {};
  pages.forEach(page => {
    page.h2s.forEach(h2 => {
      const normalized = normalizeHeader(h2);
      headerCounts[normalized] = (headerCounts[normalized] || 0) + 1;
    });
  });
  // Return headers appearing on 3+ pages
  return Object.entries(headerCounts)
    .filter(([h, count]) => count >= 3)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
}
```

### Data Storage

**MVP:** No database — generate brief on demand, no persistence.

**Later (Free Tiers):**
- Vercel KV for caching (same keyword = same brief for 24 hours)
- Supabase for saved briefs

---

## UX Details That Matter

### Input Experience

**Good:**
```
Target Keyword: [how to start a podcast        ]

Competitor URLs (paste top 5-10 from Google):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ https://example.com/start-podcast-guide         │
│ https://another.com/podcasting-101              │
│ ...                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Generate Brief →]
```

**Help text:** "Google your keyword, copy the top organic URLs (skip ads), paste here."

### Output Experience

- Sections clearly delineated
- Most important info first (word count, must-have headers)
- Each section has its own copy button
- Full brief copy at the bottom
- Visual hierarchy makes it scannable

### Loading State

Brief generation takes time. Make it feel productive:
- "Fetching competitor pages... (3/7)"
- "Analyzing content structure..."
- "Identifying patterns..."
- "Generating your brief..."

## Open Questions

1. **URL limit:** 10 URLs max per brief? Or let them paste as many as they want?
2. **Rate limiting:** How to prevent abuse (someone scraping competitors via your tool)?
3. **Caching:** Cache results for same keyword + URLs for 24 hours to save processing?
4. **Quality threshold:** Skip pages with <500 words? They're probably not useful.

---

## Differentiation Ideas

**Make the output actionable, not just data:**
- Don't just say "average word count is 2,800"
- Say "Your article should be 2,800-3,200 words to compete. The top result has 3,400 words."

**Show your work:**
- "This header appears on 8 of 10 ranking pages — definitely include it"
- "This header appears on 3 pages — consider including if relevant"

**Writer-friendly format:**
- Output should feel like a creative brief, not a data dump
- Include a "Quick Start" summary at the top
- Make it copy-paste ready for their content planning doc

---

## Success Metrics

- **Usage:** Briefs generated per week
- **Engagement:** Copy button clicks, full brief vs sections
- **Content:** Pillar article ranking for "content brief"
- **Conversion:** Email capture rate
- **Quality:** User feedback, return visits
