## Avoid AI-Sounding Content

Meta descriptions and product copy must read as naturally human-written. AI-generated content hurts credibility and may be flagged.

### Banned Phrases in SEO Copy

| Category | Examples to Avoid |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Overused transitions** | "Whether you're...", "From X to Y", "Take your X to the next level" |
| **Filler phrases** | "In today's world", "It's important to note", "When it comes to" |
| **Generic superlatives** | "exceptional", "unparalleled", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "stunning", "captivating" |
| **Passive hedging** | "can be", "may help", "is designed to" |
| **Wall art cliches** | "transform your space", "make a statement", "perfect addition to any room" |

### Good vs Bad Meta Descriptions

**Bad (AI-sounding):**
```
Whether you're a collector or casual art lover, this stunning piece is designed to transform your space and take your decor to the next level.
```

**Good (human-sounding):**
```
Gold lion portrait on premium canvas. Rich metallic tones and detailed brushwork. Multiple sizes available. Free US shipping.
```

### Quick Check

If your meta description uses any banned phrase, rewrite it. Be specific about visual elements instead of vague about benefits.

## Product Description SEO Checklist

### Minimum Requirements
- [ ] At least 50 words in long description
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] Descriptive, not just specs list
- [ ] No duplicate content from other products

### Red Flags to Fix
- Description under 25 words
- Description is just the product name repeated
- Description is copied from manufacturer without editing
- No mention of visual elements, colors, or subject
- Missing key specs (sizes available, canvas type)

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Meta description pulls from product description
**Problem:** Shopify auto-generates meta description from product body if left blank. Often results in truncated, awkward text.

**Fix:** Write a custom meta description that:
- Summarizes the artwork in one clear sentence
- Includes primary keyword
- Stays under 160 characters
- Ends with a complete thought (no cut-off mid-sentence)

### Issue: Meta title too short
**Problem:** Title is just the product name with no context.

**Fix:** Add category, key feature, or style:
- Before: `Lion Canvas`
- After: `Gold Lion Portrait Canvas | Luxury Wall Art`

### Issue: Meta title too long
**Problem:** Title exceeds 60 characters and gets truncated in search results.

**Fix:** Prioritize essential info:
- Keep subject + art type
- Add one key differentiator
- Remove redundant words ("the", "a", "and")

### Issue: Description is just specs
**Problem:** Bullet points only, no context or visual description.

**Fix:** Add 1-2 sentences before specs explaining:
- What the artwork depicts
- Color palette and mood
- Where it works well
